Welcome! This guide shows you how to quickly compare providers so you get the best overall deal for your transfer.

## 1) Know your corridor and amount

- Decide the currency pair (e.g., USD→PHP) and how much you want to send. Small vs. large amounts can change which provider is best.

## 2) Compare total cost (rate + fees)

- Check the live FX rate and all applicable fees (including payment and payout fees). The best provider usually combines a strong rate with low fees.

## 3) Confirm delivery options and speed

- Some providers offer instant wallet or cash pick-up, others do bank-only. Choose the speed and method that fits your recipient.

## 4) Lock in and send

- Once you’ve picked the top provider, confirm the final quote and complete your transfer.

> Tip: Quotes are time-limited. If you wait too long, refresh and re-compare.
