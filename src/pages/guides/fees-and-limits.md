Comparing providers means looking at total cost, not just the headline rate.

## FX rate (mid vs. markup)

- Most providers add a markup to the mid-market rate. Prefer providers with smaller markups for better value.

## Fees

- Transfer fees vary by corridor and payment method. Card and cash pick-up usually cost more than bank-to-bank.
- Watch for extra charges like intermediary bank fees on some routes.

## Limits

- Daily and monthly caps vary by provider and verification level.
- If you need higher limits, complete advanced verification before you send.
